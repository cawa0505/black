Thanks for looking.

Branches.php and ImageInfo.php (deprecated) are the linked list extensions

PNG.php is for creating the thumbnails

tier.png is for searching for the thumbnails

index.php is a example on how to use it.

Some functions are going to be deprecated. I'm still running through this

However, the package is functioning. Thanks again for looks :)
